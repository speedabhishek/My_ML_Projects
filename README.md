Red Wine Quality Prediction refers to the process of using data analysis and machine learning techniques to estimate the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties. This is a popular example in data science and is commonly explored using the Red Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Objective:
To predict the quality score of red wine (typically rated between 0 and 10) using various measurable attributes of the wine, such as acidity, sugar content, pH level, alcohol, etc.

Common Techniques Used:
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, normalization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing correlations between features and quality

Model building: Using algorithms such as:
Linear Regression
Random Forest
